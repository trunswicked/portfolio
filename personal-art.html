                <p>Below is a collection of original artwork, sketches, and fan art that I've posted to social media throughout 2023-2025. These are publically shared in order to connect with fellow creatives and potential clients for <b><a href="commission-work.html">commissions</a></b>, but I also enjoy the creation of these personal works in order to improve my skills!</p>
                <p>All illustrations were created in Clip Studio Paint.</p>
