            <section class="container pt-0">
                <h2>The Method</h2>
                <p>My senior year at The Herberger Institute of Arizona State University saw the ideation and development of an ambitious group project named the Clock Exhibit. This fully online exhibit, built using <a href="https://www.artsteps.com/">Artsteps</a>, would showcase the clock projects of 21 total students (which are themed after a societal issue of the student's choice).</p>
                <p>I would develop this exhibit alongside six teammates, further divided into three specialized teams responsible for the exhibit itself, for advertising, and for the creation of a companion booklet. As the leader of the exhibit task force, my role was to determine the layout of the Artsteps building and to manage all three-dimensional assets. Additionally, I would also be responsible for creating the Wix webpage for which the exhibit is displayed.</p>
                <p>The final exhibit may be viewed <b><a href="https://asuexhibit.wixsite.com/clockexhibit2024">here</a></b>!</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The first step of development saw various layout and visual explorations. It was eventually decided that the exhibit would have three octagonal rooms. These rooms would represent a certain theme - Mental Health, Human Rights, and Environment & Technology - and clocks would be grouped in the same manner. Additionally, the exhibit would feature a central hallway, leading into an outside entrance area.</p>
                <p>Using every student's submitted clock design, the images were arranged into a wall display. Exhibit visitors are encouraged to click on each project in order to view its title/theme and description.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Lastly, a Wix webpage was created in order to host the exhibit module. It would also function as a decorative frame, and directions as well as troubleshooting steps would be included, in the event that the module fails to load.</p>
                <p>Planning, collaboration and group meetings took place via text message, Zoom, and Miro.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
