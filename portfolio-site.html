                <h2>The Method</h2>
                <p>My portfolio site has seen many revisions and platform changes throughout the years. Originally hosted via Wix, it has always been the principal project representing my long-time interest in UI/UX and web development; and so, as I've worked to improve my front-end skills the past year, I decided it was time for another fresh coat of paint.</p>
                <p>The catch: This time, I would be coding the entire thing myself.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Following the principles of responsive design, which has been the basis of my understanding of UX, this site was developed <b>mobile-first</b>. It was also designed to meet accessibility standards. Although I had wanted to refine my foundational skills and thus decided to employ "vanilla" CSS and JavaScript to create this site, I am deeply familiar with the CSS framework Bootstrap, and took advantage of several of its utilities.</p>
                <p>After two months of development, the end result is the most robust iteration of my portfolio site to date. Fellow code-nerds may view the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/trunswicked/portfolio">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2>The Lesson</h2>
                    <p>Developing this site and building upon my front-end expertise has not only made me more confident in my ability to provide HTML, CSS, and JavaScript services, but it is also an experience I will carry forward into every future project. The knowledge is invaluable at every step of web development, as I've gained a better understanding of what may or may not be viable at a front-end level.</p>
