            <section class="container pt-0">
                <h2>The Method</h2>
                <p>As a young artist who found herself making connections through platforms such as DeviantART and Twitter back in the early 2000s, I've witnessed many of my peers offer custom artwork services, and eventually decided to advertise my own <a href="commission-work.html">digital art commissions</a>. At first, these ads weren't worth writing home about. But as I've continuously worked to improve and streamline my commission process, tackling the opportunity to build an audience, I decided to fire up inDesign and create a professional series of social media graphics that I could re-use across multiple platforms.</p>

                    <img src="images/socmed_bsky.png" class="img-h img-expand" alt="Screenshot of a Bluesky post titled 'September Commissions Open'">
                    <figcaption>
                        Graphic shown in a post on <a href="https://bsky.social/about">Bluesky</a>.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Firstly, these ads would communicate information such as pricing and the quality of my work from a quick glance. A strong visual heirarchy is required to capture attention, especially online! The graphics shown on this page were also created in tandem with my <a href="portfolio-site.html">portfolio website</a>, and utilize a similar visual style.</p>
                <p>Different platforms require different photo dimensions as well, and graphics are sized accordingly. If necessary, several iterations are saved in order to avoid any unflattering cropping.</p>

                    <h2>The Lesson</h2>
                    <p>Constructing my own social media graphics has made me keenly aware of the common practices of online advertising. It has also asssisted in improving my fundamental design skills, as well as my inDesign proficiency.</p>
