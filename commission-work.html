                <p>Below is a collection of custom illustrations I've completed throughout 2023-2025, following the guidelines of clients whom I've connected with via social media or email.</p>
                <p>While the majority of commission requests I receive include <b>character artwork</b>, covering original characters and fan art, I have also worked with clients on wildlife illustration and designing individual elements such as logos, objects, weapons, and outfits.</p>
                <p>Clip Studio Paint is my illustration tool of choice, whereas Adobe Illustrator is used for vector projects.</p>
