            <section class="container pt-0">
                <h2>The Method</h2>
                <p>As a young artist who found herself making connections through platforms such as DeviantART and Twitter in the early 2000s, I've witnessed many of my creative peers offer custom artwork services, and would eventually decide to advertise my own <a href="commission-work.html">digital art commissions</a> as well. At first, these ads weren't worth writing home about. But as I've continuously worked to improve my illustration work and streamline the commission process, I realized it may be advantageous to create a series of personal social media graphics that I could re-use across multiple platforms.</p>

                    <img src="images/socmed_bsky.png" class="img-h img-expand" alt="Screenshot of a Bluesky post titled 'September Commissions Open'">
                    <figcaption>
                        Graphic shown in a post on <a href="https://bsky.social/about">Bluesky</a>.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Firstly, these ads would communicate information such as pricing and the quality of my work from a quick glance. A strong visual heirarchy is required to capture attention, especially online! The graphics shown on this page were also created in tandem with my <a href="portfolio-site.html">portfolio website</a>, and utilize the same visual style.</p>
                <p>Different platforms require different photo dimensions as well, and graphics are sized accordingly. If necessary, several iterations are saved in order to avoid any unflattering cropping.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <h2>The Lesson</h2>
                    <p>Constructing my own social media graphics has made me keenly aware of the common practices of online advertising. It has also assisted in improving my fundamental design skills, as well as my inDesign proficiency. Additionally, several of my commissioners have cited the graphics as a factor in their decision to work with me, suggesting that their usage has indeed captured more attention!</p>
